This is the data and code associated with the following [publication](http://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5108731) (see [BibTeX file](https://github.com/kevingreenman/BInGaN-JAP2019/blob/main/journal_citation.bib) for complete citation information):

Kevin P. Greenman, Logan Williams, and Emmanouil Kioupakis, “Lattice-Constant and Band-Gap Tuning in Wurtzite and Zincblende BInGaN Alloys,” J. Appl. Phys., vol. 126, no. 5, p. 055702, Aug. 2019. DOI: 10.1063/1.5108731.

The code should be run according to the order signified by the numerical prefixes of the MATLAB scripts in the `code/` [directory](https://github.com/kevingreenman/BInGaN-JAP2019/tree/main/code). The order is important because some variables from earlier scripts are used in future scripts, so the Workspace should not be cleared in between scripts. The scripts will produce the following plots as outputs:

* `plot1_a.m`: Figure 3a

* `plot2_thermo.m`: Figures 1a, 1b, 7a, and 7c

* `plot3_Eg.m`: Figures 5, 7b, and 7d

* `plot4_c.m`: Figure 3b

* `plot5_a_ZB.m`: Figure 4

* `plot6_thermo_ZB.m`: Figures 1c and 1d

* `plot7_H_comparison.m`: Figure 2

* `plot8_Eg_ZB.m`: Figure 6
