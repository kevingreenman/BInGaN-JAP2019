abstract = {InGaN light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are more efficient and cost effective than incandescent and fluorescent lighting, but lattice mismatch limits the thickness of InGaN layers that can be grown on GaN without performance-degrading dislocations. In this work, we apply hybrid density functional theory calculations to investigate the thermodynamic stability, lattice parameters, and band gaps of wurtzite and zincblende quaternary BInGaN alloys. We find that the wurtzite phase is more stable and can be lattice-matched to GaN for BInGaN compositions containing up to {\~{}}30{\%} boron. The lattice match with GaN decreases strain and enables thicker active layers that mitigate Auger recombination and increase the efficiency of the LEDs. The band gap of the alloy remains tunable throughout the visible spectrum. Our results indicate that BInGaN alloys are promising alternatives to InGaN for high-efficiency, high-power LEDs.},
